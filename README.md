## Step 1: Fork This Repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.

This will create a copy of this repository in your account.


## Step 2: Clone The Repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the `copy to clipboard` icon.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone (place copied text here)
```

Place the url to this repository (your fork of this project) in the `(place copied text here)` spot, don't keep the parenthesis.

**For example:**

```
git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/Quotes-Generator.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the Quotes-Generator repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Step 3: Create a Branch

If you're not already there, change to the repository's directory in your terminal:

```
cd Quotes-Generator
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

**For example:**

```
git checkout -b add-whatever-you-want
```

## Step 4: Making and Committing Changes

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see that there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add <...>"
```

## Step 5: Push Changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin -u <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Step 6: Submit Your Changes for Review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.
